            People would describe me as an easy-going person, and I personally
            think youâ€™d definitely enjoy grabbing a beer or coffee with me. I
            consider myself mostly as a resourceful and ingenious explorer and
            planner with an entrepreneurial and innovative mindset. I like
            planning my next destination and I always enjoy the journey to every
            destination in life, even if unplanned conditions are met halfway.
            So it is obvious why I like sailing as well as learning how to
            respond to wind-direction changes.
          </p>

          <p className="i-5 mt-4 pt-2">
            In my work life, I like building things for the web, and in my free
            time I enjoy all types of creative, learning and physical
            activities, keeping a balance between spirit, mind and body. So, one
            could say that what I don't like is inactivity, apathy and
            meaningless waste of time.
          </p>

          <p className="i-5 mt-4 pt-2">
            As a {occupation} Iâ€™ve been designing and writing code since my late
            teens (that period seems further and further away now!). So far,
            Iâ€™ve avoided to put myself under one labelâ€‰â€”â€‰to specialise in one
            thing onlyâ€‰â€”â€‰and instead gone for this Jack of all Trades role in
            the various teams Iâ€™ve had the pleasure of working with. But doing
            so for that long I gained a good experience as a generalist in
            anything that has to do with data analysis, visualisations, business
            intelligence, product, machine learning and deep learning. I
            specialize, though, in software development for the mobile-web, both
            in front and backend. In the latest years, I work as a Senior{" "}
            {occupation} in financial sector. I have worked in startups and in
            big-companies, in small research teams with loose product focus and
            in large tight teams with laser focus on the mission. Iâ€™ve loved and
            love being part of that career journey.
          </p>

          <p className="i-5 mt-4 pt-2">
            Currently, at my job, I develop in Typescript and Angular for the
            frontend, while also in Java for the backend, and in my latest
            personal projects I enjoy React and GraphQL.
          </p>

          <p className="i-5 mt-4 pt-2">
            As for non-tech things, Iâ€™ve become more and more interested in the
            methods of leading teams and how to work smarter. That is, how the
            well-being of each team member is kept central while the work can
            progress in a smooth way.

          <p className="i-5 mt-4 pt-2">
            I love traveling, and I plan to expand my traveling-territory in the
            following years, as for now I have only travelled in half of
            European countries. I have also traveled in 80% of Greek main roads
            and the surrounding cities, about 30 Greek islands and 60% of Cyprus
            main roads and surrounding cities. I have lived in total 1.5 years
            in Cyprus, 28 years in Greece and the rest in Switzerland. As of
            September 2019, Iâ€™ve settled in Zurich, Switzerland.

          <p className="i-5 mt-4 pt-2">
            From my childhood, my family and my surrounding people taught me
            some values that I respect, appreciate and forward. Some of these
            are: goodness, kindness, environmentalism, peace, freedom, equality,
            respect for privacy and volunteering. If you want to learn more
