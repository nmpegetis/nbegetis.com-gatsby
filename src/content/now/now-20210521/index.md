## Since the last update
*Nothing here yet*

## Currently
Even though there are too many things to write down about what I am doing now, it is so hard to select the worthy onesâ€¦ I have to put my thoughts down and prioritize what I am doing and what is worth mentioning. This is going to be a long one as it is my first, but I promise the next one will be shorter.

Ok let's start. Currently, and for the last months, I believe I am walking through a period of self-improvement, mentally and physically. This was triggered during the Covid-19 period and the lockdowns. In the long run, in the past 1 year I have lost 10kg due to exercise and training and I have set a goal to lose 5 more. I already feel super, as it's been almost 8 years since the last time I was in this shape. I have put training in my everyday life balance and I plan to keep it.

What is more, I have started again some online courses to improve my career and I decided to do some personal projects (like this webpage) in order to feel more creative and to try some new technologies while doing so.

The past few months, I was lucky to live in Switzerland and even though there were some restrictions that kept bars, restaurants, etc. closed, I managed to travel a lot, make a new love (skiing) and fill my brain with lots of pictures from Switzerland's landscapes. Some of the places I visited were: <a href="https://www.flimslaax.com/" target="_blank">Flims/Laax/Falera</a> villages (4 times, the first was for a ski week), <a href="https://www.davos.ch/" target="_blank">Davos</a> (2 times for skiing), <a href="http://www.veysonnaz.ch/" target="_blank">Veyssonaz</a>/<a href="https://www.sion.ch/" target="_blank">Sion</a>/<a href="https://www.zermatt.ch/en" target="_blank">Zermatt</a> (2 times, for an extended weekend and for a day trip), <a href="https://www.verbier.ch/ete/" target="_blank">Verbier</a> (for an extended weekend), <a href="https://www.neuchatelville.ch/" target="_blank">Neuchatel</a>, <a href="https://www.luganoregion.com/en" target="_blank">Lugano</a> and more. 

This time period I also managed to organize my banking accounts and gather all the information of the last 2 years in an excel. My plan for doing so, is to improve my financial life.

As a new year's resolution, me and my girlfriend, we decided to track our monthly and weekly goals and scoring them. We use an agile approach of weekly sprints (we use <a href="https://trello.com/" target="_blank">Trello</a>) and we have a planning every once per month. So far we manage to keep our promise and we continue working this resolution. This has helped us a lot comparing to past years as we keep track of our everyday life and as a result we have reduced a lot the procrastination time that most times it is just a waste.

Finally, currently in my free time I enjoy:
	1. Reading/listening some books, 
	2. Playing chess with Margarita on this <a href="https://squareoffnow.com/" target="_blank">board</a> (present from a cousin of mine),
	3. Studying some economics for my work and for personal reasons.

## New assets
I also made some 4 big expenses in assets that I expect them to last:

1. I bought a <a href="https://buy.garmin.com/de-DE/DE/p/643260" target="_blank">Garmin</a> watch to track my fitness, and I also connected it to <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/73291755" target="_blank">Strava</a>. Sharing my activities, keeps me motivated as I feel empowered and that I have a mutual understanding about the effort needed amongst my followers. Also, the watch so far helps me to keep better tracking of the exercises and the so useful feature to map the paths that you followed with GPS and the ability to analyze segments of your exercise and each time try to improve little by little to get closer to the goal, by comparing your fitness and health progress with others and most importantly with the past-YOU.
2. I bought my skis. I started the winter season by renting some beginner skis and a bit after the mid of the season, feeling already comfortable and ready for the next step, I tried some other ones that were suitable for experienced skiers. Finally, by the end of the season, and having already loved my <a href="https://elanskis.com/eu/mens-skis/all-mountain" target="_blank">Amphibio</a> (I love this Greek word) skis I decided to buy them.
3. I bought a <a href="https://gopro.com/en/us/shop/cameras/hero9-black/CHDHX-901-master.html" target="_blank">GoPro</a> camera, to accompany my Garmin watch and my skis ðŸ˜Š. It really worth it. I take it with me everywhere in outdoor activities. I have already tried it while skiing, hiking, cycling, even when swimming :p.
4. I received a <a href="https://www.dji.com/ch/mini-2" target="_blank">DJI Mini 2</a> drone as a gift and I bought all the accompanying extra assets (batteries, carrying bag, etc.) and this become instantly another love at first sight this year. You can see the world and the surrounding environment through totally different angles, altitudes, name it. So far, I have taken amazing footage of wonderful places. I have already flown in snow and in dessert (Cyprus), above lakes and above sea, in 2500m altitude and in 0m, in -10 Celsius degrees and in 36 Celsius degrees. I really hope one day to organize all of this footage from both goPro and the drone and start some video editing and uploading, because it really worth it and it will be a shame if I don't do this.
5. I bought a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/my/vacuum-cleaners/robot/robot-vr05r5050wk/" target="_blank">RoboCleaner</a> dust and mop machine. Mostly because I calculated that it will save me 4 days per year (100h), and so I said the sooner I buy it the more benefit I will gain from it. This is my newest possession and still I haven't seen its full potential, it is ongoing :).
6. I bought a mini <a href="https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/portable-drives/sandisk-extreme-usb-3-1-ssd#SDSSDE60-2T00-G25" target="_blank">external ssd disk</a> because I noticed that in the first month of capturing video footage with my GoPro and my drone I overpassed the 200GB of storage memory. The reason I decided to buy this one despite being more expensive, was mostly because of size, weight and its resistance to rain, splashes, spills, and dust, as I may take it with me in hikes, etc.
